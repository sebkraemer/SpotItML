# SpotItML Project Requirements

## Overview
SpotItML is a cross-platform mobile application that uses machine learning to recognize symbols on Spot It! (Dobble) cards through the device camera.

## Functional Requirements

### FR-1: Cross-Platform Compatibility
**User Story**: As a user, I want to use the application on both Android and iOS devices.
**Expected Behavior**: The application runs correctly on both Android and iOS devices with equivalent functionality.

### FR-2: Camera Integration
**User Story**: As a user, I want to use my device's camera to capture images of Spot It! cards.
**Expected Behavior**: When I tap the camera button, the device camera activates, allowing me to capture images of cards.

### FR-3: Symbol Recognition
**User Story**: As a user, I want the app to recognize symbols on Spot It! cards from my camera feed.
**Expected Behavior**: The app processes the camera image and correctly identifies symbols present on Spot It! cards.

### FR-4: Symbol Display
**User Story**: As a user, I want to see which symbols the app has recognized.
**Expected Behavior**: Recognized symbols are displayed on screen with clear visual representation.

### FR-5: Offline Processing
**User Story**: As a user, I want to use the app without requiring an internet connection.
**Expected Behavior**: All ML processing occurs locally on the device without sending data to external servers.

## Technical Requirements

### TR-1: Local ML Inference
**Story**: As a developer, I need to implement efficient ML inference on the device.
**Expected Outcome**: C++ implementation with ONNX Runtime processes images and identifies symbols within 2 seconds.

### TR-2: Native Code Integration
**Story**: As a developer, I need to bridge Flutter with native C++ code.
**Expected Outcome**: FFI integration seamlessly connects the Flutter UI with the C++ ML inference engine.

### TR-3: Performance Optimization
**Story**: As a developer, I need to ensure the app runs efficiently on mid-range devices.
**Expected Outcome**: ML model is quantized and optimized for mobile deployment with minimal memory footprint.

### TR-4: Error Handling
**Story**: As a developer, I need robust error handling across the app.
**Expected Outcome**: Native code errors are properly caught, logged, and communicated to the Flutter layer.

## Non-Functional Requirements

### NFR-1: Response Time
**Requirement**: Symbol recognition should complete within 2 seconds of image capture.
**Measurement**: Time from image capture to results display should not exceed 2 seconds on target devices.

### NFR-2: Device Compatibility
**Requirement**: The application should function on mid-range devices from the last 3 years.
**Measurement**: Successful operation on defined test devices with acceptable performance metrics.

### NFR-3: Application Size
**Requirement**: The application installation size should be optimized.
**Measurement**: Total installed size should not exceed 100MB including the ML model.

## Future Considerations (Not in current scope)

### FC-1: Game Mode Implementation
**User Story**: As a user, I might want to play Spot It! against the app or other players.

### FC-2: Symbol Training
**User Story**: As a user, I might want to train the app to recognize custom symbols.
